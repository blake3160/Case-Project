        Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), also known as action real-time strategy (ARTS),
        is a subgenre of strategy video games that originated as a subgenre of real-time strategy
        in which each player controls a single character, often through a bird's-eye view, as part
        of a team competing against another team of players. Often the objective is to destroy the
        opposing team's main structure with the assistance of periodically-spawned computer-controlled 
        units that march forward along set path
