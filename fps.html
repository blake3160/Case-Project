        <p>A first Person shooter(FPS) is a video game that is centered
        around gun and other weapon based combat. The game places you
        in the first-person view of the protagonist or protagonists
        of the game you are playing.</p>

      <p> The first FPS game was created by a company called id Software.
        this game was called "Catacomb 3-D", This game wasn't really
        published or distributed so it wasn't widely known. Later the
        same company put out a new game called "Wolfenstine 3-D" and
        it was marked well and gained lots popularity. Thus the FPS
        genre was born and has massed into one of the most played
        genres ever.</p>
