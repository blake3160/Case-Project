        <p>
            A role playing game can take  on many forms, but the general idea is the same: a
            game in which one plays the role of a character other than themself, usually in 
            a fantasy setting. Following the breakout success of J.R.R. Tolkien's popular 
            works of fiction, the fantasy genre was formed. It comes as no surprise that
            when video games became a pastime, fantasy soon became involved.

            Early role playing games, or RPGs, started simple as most genres are known to
            have done. Adventure for the Atari 2600 had a narrative in its manual, but 
            only demonstrated in game a little square gliding through mazes and avoiding 
            strange creatures so as to acquire a chalice.

            Later on, as video games developed better hardware, RPGs became 
            more complex. Chrono Trigger for the Super Nintendo had a wide array of sound 
            effects and colors, an in game narrative, characters with written dialogue 
            and systems for engaging with friendly non-player characters or unfriendly 
            monsters.

            Contemporary RPGs now feature much more than those of the past, including 
            voiced characters, explorable territory which can span hundreds of 
            kilometers and fully-animated, three-dimensional models which interact with
            their worlds.
